<div id="about-text">
    <p>OP Translations is a new Light Novel/Web Novel translation group that will specialize in stories with overpowered main characters.
    Who doesn't like those characters? It's always a good time to watch the side cast oogle in awe of the main character's abilities.
    </p>
    <p>We're a very small team (one translator and one editor) at the moment, so we'll be concentrating on one project at a time.
        Our first project is, in English, Counter Stop!, and you might have guessed, there's a wonderfully OP character in it.
        It's a web novel, meaning the original text is not professionally edited, and thus a bit rough at times, which leads me in to how we translate.
    </p>
    <p> The philosphy here is that if we are going to read in English, we want it to read like a native English text. We're not saying we'll
        be winning a Pulitzer or a Hugo or anything, but we most certainly will not be directly translating the text and leaving it be.
        We will <strong>always</strong> preserve the orignal meaning and intention of the work, however.
    </p>
    <p>The site itself was designed as a side project during a few days off from translating, and will be improved upon over time.
        For now, it's just a plain site that's functional enough read with on any device.
        You can also use the 'Invert Colors' option in the navigation to flip the colors, if that works better for your eyes.
